AWS Account with programmatic access and AWS CLI configured.
Python 3 installed.
Docker and Kubectl installed.
Code editor (e.g., VSCode).
Part 1: Deploying the Flask application locally
Step 1: Clone the code
Step 2: Install dependencies
The application requires the psutil, Flask, Plotly, and boto3 libraries. Install them using pip
Step 3: Run the application
To run the application, navigate to the root directory of the project and execute the following command:
$ python3 app.py
Part 2: Dockerizing the Flask application
Step 1: Create a Dockerfile
Create a Dockerfile in the root directory of the project with the provided contents.

Step 2: Build the Docker image:
$ docker build -t <image_name> .

Step 3: Run the Docker container
Run the Docker container using the following command
$ docker run -p 5000:5000 <image_name>



Part 3: Pushing the Docker image to ECR
Step 1: Create an ECR repository
Create an ECR repository using the provided Python script.

Step 2: Push the Docker image to ECR
Push the Docker image to ECR using the appropriate docker push command.

Part 4: Creating an EKS cluster and deploying the app using Python
Step 1: Create an EKS cluster
Create an EKS cluster and add a node group.

Step 2: Create a deployment and service
Use the provided Python script to create a Kubernetes deployment and service for the Flask application.

Remember to replace the image URI on line 25 with your ECR image URI.

Once you run the script, the deployment and service will be created. Check the status using the provided Kubernetes commands.

Congratulations! You have successfully completed the Cloud Native Resource Monitoring Python App on K8s project. Now you have a scalable and efficient resource monitoring application deployed on Amazon EKS.

Feel free to explore and modify the project to further enhance your knowledge and skills in cloud-native application development! Happy coding! ðŸš€
